# Website Specifications
- You can make this website about anything that you want (or nothing at all: you can just use filler text) as long as you meet the general layout guidelines
- After you finish implementing the specifications, explore additional features with materialize or general html/css and try to make your website the prettiest
- We will do a showcase of everyone's websites at the end of the meeting. Push your website to your forked repo and enable github pages.
